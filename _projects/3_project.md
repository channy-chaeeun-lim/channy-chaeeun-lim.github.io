**Can the physical layout of buttons help the brain filter out distractions?** In any interface, we are bombarded with "task-irrelevant" information—like the position of a button distracting us from its label. When this irrelevant information triggers a conflicting impulse, it slows us down. I investigated whether the physical topology of an interface (e.g., how we move our hands) changes how our brain processes this conflict. Specifically, I asked: _Can the spatial arrangement of controls intrinsically help users filter out noise?_

**I designed an experiment alternating between Horizontal and Vertical tasks.** To understand how the brain maps space, I compared two response layouts for handling Horizontally (Left/Right) and Vertically (Up/Down) arranged stimuli:

- **Unified Mode:** Performing both horizontal and vertical tasks with a **single hand** (grouping controls).
- **Separated Mode:** Performing horizontal tasks with the left hand and vertical tasks with the right hand (splitting controls).

I used an Aimed-Movement Paradigm (reaching from a home key to a target key) for two strategic reasons: 1) It allowed a single hand to naturally access the full 2D space, and 2) It allowed me to decompose reaction time. By separating Initiation Time (planning) from Movement Time (execution), I could observe exactly when the cognitive filter operates—from the moment of thought to the final button press.

**Findings: Unified inputs create a "Shared Cognitive Space."** My results demonstrated that the physical design of controls profoundly alters cognitive processing:

1. **Unified Controls Merge Spatial Maps:** When users used the Unified Mode, the brain "reconfigured" the distinct Horizontal and Vertical dimensions into a single mental category. This allowed the brain to successfully transfer cognitive control—applying a "focus strategy" learned in the horizontal task to solve the vertical task.
2. **Control is "In-Flight":** Surprisingly, this benefit appeared most strongly in Movement Time. This proves that with the right layout, the brain continues to actively filter distractions and correct errors _during the physical motion itself_.

**A Cognitive Framework for Interface Layout** This research provides strong evidence that the conceptual and physical grouping of controls matters for safety and efficiency. It offers a clear framework for UI designers: complex interfaces should unify related inputs physically. A well-designed control scheme can offload cognitive work from the user, making it easier to naturally inhibit distractions and reduce error rates in high-stakes environments.
