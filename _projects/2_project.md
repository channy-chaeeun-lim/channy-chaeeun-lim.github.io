**Brown University \| PhD Researcher (Vision Science)**

**Do you trust your own perception of 3D space?** We interact with the 3D world constantly and effortlessly. However, my research asks a critical question: _Is our perception actually accurate?_ For example, that building you are looking at might not be as far as you perceive, or the apple in the tree might not be as big as you think.

**I developed an "Ecological Metric" to reveal hidden biases.** Traditional studies often rely on verbal reports or relative measurements, which are prone to conscious guessing and often lack ecological validity. To overcome this, I designed a **sensorimotor adaptation task** in a haptic-enabled VR environment. By asking participants to naturally reach for and grasp virtual objects, I measured the _true_ perceptual bias experienced by the sensory system—capturing the "unconscious" error that occurs before the brain corrects for it.

**Findings: Our perception is biased, but our actions adapt.** My data provided conclusive evidence of two systematic errors:

1. **Overestimation:** We consistently perceive objects in near-space as farther and deeper (more elongated) than they physically are.
2. **The Realism Paradox:** Surprisingly, adding realistic cues like shading and texture _increased_ this perceptual error.

**Impact: Design for Adaptation, not just Geometry.** Crucially, I found that despite these biases, users can still perform successful actions because our motor system automatically adapts via **online correction**. This implies that achieving "natural" interaction isn't about rendering perfect physical geometry. Instead, systems should prioritize **sensory feedback loops** (like visual cursors or haptic confirmation) that allow users to leverage their natural adaptation mechanisms to close the gap between what they see and what they touch.
