**Why do 2D design rules fail in a 3D world?** We often assume interacting in VR is as simple as tapping a smartphone screen. However, XR introduces a fundamental friction: the lack of tactile feedback and the natural biological "jitter" of eye-gaze and hand-tracking inputs. While controller-free interaction feels natural, it lacks the pixel-perfect precision of a mouse or touchscreen. This created a critical need to establish new, evidence-based standards for target sizing and interaction features specifically for XR.

**I led a mixed-methods initiative to extend Material Design into 3D.** As a researcher on the Material Design platform team, I partnered closely with the Android XR team (designers, engineers, vision researchers, and PMs) to translate abstract psychophysics into concrete UI standards. I drove a multi-phase research program to establish and validate new design guidelines for XR:

- **Gap Analysis:** Conducted a comprehensive audit of competitor systems (e.g., Apple, Meta, Microsoft) to identify industry-wide usability gaps.
- **Rigorous Behavioral Experiments:** Designed controlled behavioral experiments in VR to quantify performance metrics (precision, accuracy, and response times) across varying target sizes and input modalities, specifically manipulating interactive features like hover states.
- **Contextual Validation:** Moved beyond controlled experimentation to ensure ecological validity. I developed high-fidelity prototypes of realistic UI components to validate our quantitative models against qualitative user expectations in representative usage scenarios.

**Impact:** Shaping the Material Design Language for XR. This research provided the empirical foundation for Material Design's adaptation to the XR space. By quantifying the critical trade-off between ergonomic accuracy (which requires larger targets) and information density (which demands compact UI), my work delivered a strategic roadmap for the design system. These findings provided the foundational standards that help designers and developers build immersive applications that are comfortable and intuitive, without sacrificing design intent.
