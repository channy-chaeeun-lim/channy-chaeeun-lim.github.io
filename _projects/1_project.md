Why do 2D design rules fail in a 3D world? We often assume interacting in VR is as simple as tapping a smartphone screen. However, XR introduces a fundamental friction: the lack of tactile feedback and the natural biological "jitter" of eye-gaze and hand-tracking inputs. While controller-free interaction feels natural, it lacks the pixel-perfect precision of a mouse or touchscreen. This created a critical need to establish new, evidence-based standards for target sizing and interaction features specifically for XR.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
