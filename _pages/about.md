Hi, I'm Channy! 👋

I am a UX Researcher and Cognitive Psychologist dedicated to designing systems that align with the natural characteristics and limitations of human perception and cognition. I specialize in bridging the gap between rigorous academic science and real-world product design—transforming empirical evidence into actionable design strategies to create experiences where users naturally make fewer errors and genuinely feel "understood" by the products they use.

Most recently, I applied this philosophy as a UX Research Intern at [Google](https://about.google) ([Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) & [Android XR](https://developer.android.com/xr)). There, I led mixed-methods research to establish foundational design guidelines that allow users to have efficient, comfortable interactions in the XR space—ultimately building a scientific foundation for more natural interactions in spatial computing.

This ability to bridge science and design comes from my mastery of two distinct domains: **perception** and **cognition**.

Currently, as a Ph.D. Candidate in Cognitive Science at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) (expected May 2026) working with the [3D Information for Perception & Action Lab](https://sites.brown.edu/3dipalab/), my research explores our **perceptual limitations**—uncovering hidden biases in human 3D perception and how our motor systems cleverly adapt to them. Prior to this, during my M.S. in Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience at [Korea University](https://www.korea.ac.kr/sites/en/index.do), I built my expertise in our **cognitive limitations** at [Human Performance Lab](http://hplab.korea.ac.kr), investigating human response tendencies, multi-tasking, and how the brain handles distraction and response inhibition.

By mastering these two pillars, I have developed a holistic view of the user interaction cycle: how we see an interface, how we process the information, and how we physically execute action.

### My Core Toolkit

- **Research Methods:** Mixed-Methods Design, Behavioral & Psychophysics VR Experiments, Chronometric Analysis, Usability Testing.
- **Technical Skills:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), R (ggplot), SQL, Qualtrics.
- **Domain Expertise:** AR/VR/XR Interactions, Human Factors Engineering, Motor Control, Vision Science.
- **Languages:** Trilingual (English, Korean, and currently learning a third!).
